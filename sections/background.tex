\label{chap:background}

This chapter gives background information about the main concepts and technologies involved in this project. It first covers the Android operating system, the Dalvik virtual machine, and the Dalvik executable format which we will be the input to the compiler's front-end. It then briefly outlines the LLVM compiler infrastructure, specifically LLVM intermediate representation, which is our target language.
