Android is an open-source, Linux-based operating system for mobile devices. Intended for smarthphones and tablet computers, it was developed by the Open Handset Alliance, led by Google. The Android operating system was first developed by Android Inc. in 2003 by a small group of industry professionals. Google aquired the company in 2005, and in 2007 the Open Handset Alliance announced itself. The Open Handset Alliance is a consortium of several companies including HTC, Nvidia, Qualcomm, ARM Holdings, and Google itself\cite{oha_members}. Its aim is to develop open standards for mobile devices. The Android Open Source Project is responsible for the development and maintenance of Android, and is led by Google.

Android is currently the best-selling smartphone operating system on the market\cite{android_top}, as of Q4 2010. According to Google's Andy Rubin, as of February 2012, there are over 300 million Android devices in use and over 850,000 Android devices are activated every day\cite{android_sold}.
