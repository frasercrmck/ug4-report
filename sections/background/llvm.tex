\label{sec:llvm}

LLVM (formerly the Low-Level Virtual Machine\cite{llvm_name}) is a compiler infrastructure designed for compile-time, link-time, run-time and `idle-time' optimization of programs. It provides a collection of tools and libraries that facilitate the building of compilers, just-in-time compilers, optimizers, and other such compiler-related programs. At its core it features a single, language-independent virtual instruction set called the LLVM intermediate representation (IR). This intermediate representation is used both as the compiler's internal representation and to communicate code between compiler phases.
 Although originally written in C++, it has since spawned a variety of front-ends, including Python, Ruby, Objective-C, and others.
