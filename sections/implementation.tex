\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chap:implementation}

Translating from one programming paradigm to another presents numerous challenges to the compiler writer. This section will highlight the main challenges encountered in the mapping from the object-oriented Dalvik executable format to the lower-level, procedural LLVM intermediate representation.

Note that, for brevity, code samples in this chapter will be pseudo-versions of their respective languages, and not completely valid blocks of code.
