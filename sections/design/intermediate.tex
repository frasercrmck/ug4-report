\section{Intermediate Representation}
\label{sec:irep}

Unlike most compilers, we will not optimize the Dalvik executable file between the parsing and code generation stages, as we will rely on LLVM's powerful optimizations to do the work for us. We can also assume that the source program as given to us has been optimized twice already: firstly in the compilation of the Java package, and secondly in the translation from the .class files to the Dalvik executable file.

The resulting internal format handed by the Dalvik executable parser is similar to that of the input file, albeit with several changes. Some details are stored implicitly, such as the size of a given list of items. The data is additionally made more encapsulated than it is in the raw file format; items that usually lie in the `data' area of the file are moved to their relative `superclasses'.
