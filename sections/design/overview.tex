\section{Overview}

This compiler will adhere to the general design of any compiler. We will first parse the input file, and construct an intermediate representation that we will then use to generate our target language: LLVM bytecode. Sections \ref{sec:parsing}, \ref{sec:irep}, and \ref{sec:codegen} will further detail the processes of Parsing, Intermediate Representation, and Code Generation, respectively. Section \ref{sec:diss} will document another stage of the compiler, the Dalvik executable disassembler.
