Dalvik is the process virtual machine for Google's Android operating system, and is therefore at the heart of the best-selling smartphone platform in the world \cite{android_sold}. The LLVM project provides an infrastructure for creating compilers, debuggers, optimisers, and just-in-time compilers. LLVM's intermediate representation is both specifically designed for facilitating aggressive and customisable optimisations, as well as being able to be run just-in-time on the LLVM compiler. This project aims to provide a Dalvik front-end for LLVM bytecode, whereby translated Android applications can benefit from the optimisations offered by LLVM and the increases in performance brought about as a result. The project provides encouraging results for an inital prototype, with much scope for future work.
