Dalvik is the process virtual machine for Google's Android operating system, and is therefore at the heart of the best-selling smartphone platform in the world \cite{android_sold}. The LLVM project provides an infrastructure for creating compilers, debuggers, optimisers, and just-in-time compilers. This project aims to provide a Dalvik frontend for LLVM, by which translated Android applications can benefit from the optimisations offered by LLVM and the increases in performance possible as a result.
