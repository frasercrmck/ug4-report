I wish to thank my supervisor, Bj\"{o}rn Franke, for his inspiration and support throughout the project. I would also like to thank the posters on the LLVM-dev mailing list, in particular Chris Lattner and Duncan Sands, for clarifying various points about the LLVM system, and for providing solutions to some of the problems I encountered along the way.
